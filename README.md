## 1. Flashcard and Quiz Generator Bot
In this project, I developed an interactive Flashcard and Quiz Generator App using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with Shadcn UI components for a polished user experience.

- Flashcard Generation:
Users can create flashcards by entering a topic or concept. The app automatically generates flashcards with key terms, definitions, and helpful examples through internal logic or AI-based integration.

- Interactive Quiz Generation:
Users can generate quizzes based on a specific topic or concept. The app uses predefined logic (or AI) to create adaptive quizzes, delivering questions that help users assess and reinforce their knowledge.
